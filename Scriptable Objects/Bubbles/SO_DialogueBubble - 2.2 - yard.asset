  sentences:
  - You follow Scout into the school yard. The main campus building stands on a tall
    hill, and the yard stretches on its entire eastern slope.
  - The yard is surrounded by a short metal fence, with the bank of the small Claymore
    River not far.
  - ' You see many kids walking or chilling around the riverbank, even though it''s
    probably not allowed.'
  - You gather your thoughts and catch up to Scout, who has wandered over to an empty
    lunch table, which looks exactly like a picnic table you ate at during your many
    summer cub camps.
