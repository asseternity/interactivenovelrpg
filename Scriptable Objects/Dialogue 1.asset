  sentences:
  - "Siobhan awoke to the Irish sun spilling in the open doorframe of their single-room
    cottage. Her back pressed against Sean\u2019s, and she moved carefully so as
    to not wake him on his day off morning duties\u2014 today, she would feed the
    cattle and chickens. She rolled over, a stray mattress feather poking her side,
    and saw Aoife\u2019s small body in her basket, enveloped by a blanket. A surge
    in Siobhan\u2019s chest shot her awake\u2014Aoife hadn\u2019t cried once through
    the night. Siobhan scrambled to her feet, bare soles pressed into the cool packed
    dirt, no longer minding waking Sean. Aoife was still breathing, gently, though
    not stirring from her slumber."
  - The night before, Siobahn and Sean had broken many unforetold rules. They left
    their beautiful blond-haired, blue-eyed baby directly across an open door, ripe
    for the taking. The child was decorated with no red berries from rowan trees,
    nor garlands woven of daisies. Most egregious, they left no pail of buttermilk
    outside their front door on the Feast of the Assumption.
  - "Though she was breathing, something had to be wrong. Aoife usually had Siobhan
    up half the night. Was it too soon for her to be starving? The rhythm of Aoife\u2019s
    tiny chest rising and falling didn\u2019t convince Siobhan that she would actually
    wake up. So, Siobahn was about to break another rule\u2014she would wake a sleeping
    baby."
