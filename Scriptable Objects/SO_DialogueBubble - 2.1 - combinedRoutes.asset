  sentences:
  - '"Following me, or are you just gonna stand there?" the leather-jacketed student
    smirks.'
  - You hesitate for a moment, but then walk after them through the school hallways.
    They could know important info about this school.
  - The person walks quickly but relaxedly, hands in the pockets of their jeans.
  - '"Name''s Scout, by the way," they say. Their frazzled black curly hair gives
    the skinny student an androgynous look.'
  - '"So you think you''re tough, huh?" Scout smiles, glancing back at you as you
    follow them.'
  - '"Good at taking advice, gathering information, I take it?" Scout smiles, glancing
    back at you.'
  - '"''Making connections'', huh?" Scout smirks as they glance back at you. "I see
    you''re a hell of a shark already."'
  - '"Good, you''ll need that around here," they say as they enter the school yard,
    gesturing for you to follow them.'
